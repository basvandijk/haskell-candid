Candid for Haskell
==================

This repository contains experiments trying to figure out how to best connect
[Candid] to Haskell. Everything is still in flux, so better move on.

You can find the documentation for the library on
<https://nomeata.github.io/haskell-candid/Codec-Candid.html>.

This package also comes with a `hcandid` command line tool, to convert between binary and textual candid. Just run `hcandid --help` to see how to use it.
